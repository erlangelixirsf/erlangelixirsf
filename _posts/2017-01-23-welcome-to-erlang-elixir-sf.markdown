It's an exciting month for Erlang & Elixir SF. We've got two separate
events happening up and down the Peninsula:

### Talks
[Pete Hastie](https://twitter.com/sillypog), a backend developer at Bleacher Report, will talk about GenStage and how it's revolutionized the way we consume analytics data at b/r.  He'll also be speaking next month at the [Erlang & Elixir Factory SF](http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2017/peter-hastie.html).

[Jason Chen](https://twitter.com/jhchen), founder of slab.com, a new platform for team knowledge, will share how they built and scaled their realtime collaboration feature using Agents and GenServer. [Slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/796228/elixir-meetup.pdf)

Control flow in Elixir - Going back to basics, [Anna Neyzberg](https://twitter.com/ANeyzb) will cover how control flow in Elixir differs from most modern imperative languages. We will dicuss how/when to use pattern matching, multiclause functions, conditional expressions and loops.  This talk is great for people who are just starting to learn Elixir.
